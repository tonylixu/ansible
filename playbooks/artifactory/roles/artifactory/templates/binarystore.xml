  ~ baseDataDir - The root directory where Artifactory should store data files.
  ~ fileStoreDir - The root folder of binaries for the filestore. If the value specified
                   starts with a forward slash (/) the value is considered the fully qualified
                   path to the filestore folder. Otherwise, it is considered relative to the baseDataDir.
  ~ tempDir - A temporary folder under baseDataDir into which files are written for internal use by Artifactory.
              This must be on the same disk as the fileStoreDir.
